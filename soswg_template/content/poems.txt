<strong>A few poems by Joe:</strong>

You're like the sunshine
I'm like the moon
I'm only pretty
When I reflect you

====

Been snowing
    in bits and bobs
    Today
Wind blowing,
    in fits, the fog
    Away

====

I beat the sunrise up
like a fighter without boxing gloves

====

if only we could see the stars
they are there behind the clouds

====

the old woman laughs
like a ticking alarm clock
rhythmic and hoarseâ€¦ERRRT!

====

last year was the year of the 17-year cicadas.
all night, every night that summer, they buzzed and screeched.

for three months it was too hot to close the window,
and too loud to keep it open.

now, tonight, sitting on my balcony, reading non-fiction,
I hear one.

one pathetic cicada overslept.

====

The tide comes and goes
sometimes thief, sometimes giver
rising and sinking
